# Assignment Submission Portal

This project is an assignment submission portal built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **React**, along with **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** and **Jest** for testing. It demonstrates:

- Client-side form validation and data submission.
- Mocking API requests using MSW.
- Testing React components with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Configuring Babel and TypeScript to handle JSX and TypeScript in tests.
- Integrating the Next.js router in tests.

- **Next.js (App Router)**: Modern routing architecture with SSR and SSG capabilities.
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for improved reliability and code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **React Hook Form**: Client-side form state management and validation.
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: API request mocking for test isolation and reduced backend dependency.
- **Jest, React Testing Library & user-event**: Component testing, validation checks, and user interaction simulation.
